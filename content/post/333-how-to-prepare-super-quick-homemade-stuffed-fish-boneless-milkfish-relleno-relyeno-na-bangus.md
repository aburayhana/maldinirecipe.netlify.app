recipeingredient:
- "1 medlarge Milkfish Bangus"
- "1 medium carrot grated"
- "2-3 medium onions chopped"
- "4-5 cloves garlic chopped"
- "4 large calamansi"
- "3-4 Tbsp soy sauce"
- "to taste Salt  pepper"
- "1 egg beaten"
- " Cooking oil"
- " Needle and string"
recipeinstructions:
- "At the store, have them remove the scales and fins of the bangus or milkfish. Or do it yourself. Careful not to tear the skin of the fish."
- "Slit a small opening with your knife (2-2.5 inches) on the top (bone area), cut starting from the fish head. This is so you can remove the guts, bones, and get the meat. Experts do it just from the head/gill opening alone. This is harder, you can try though :) Cut the main fish bone attached to the head, and try to detach it from the skin. Remove the inedible guts of the fish, in the head area and just before the stomach. Place over running water to clean off the blood. Continue pulling on the main fish bone, use the back of a spoon to separate the meat from the skin. Remember not to tear the skin when you remove the bones and flesh. Leave the stomach area (black fatty part- delicious) attached. Try to get the skin inside out through the small slit you created so you can properly remove the flesh and bones. Always wash off any blood then collect in a bowl."
- "Once the fish is just all head+skin, marinate it in 1-2 calamansi juice and 1-2 Tbsp soy sauce, depending on how large your fish is. Set aside."
- "In a pot place all the fish meat and bones and cover. Cook at medium heat. Don&#39;t place water, as liquid will come out from the fish meat. Do not season yet."
- "Once cooked, remove from heat, strain and let cool. Discard fish broth or keep for use in another dish. Once meat cools, start de-boning. Remove all fish bones including thin, small ones. Those are annoying. ;)"
- "In a wok, heat oil and saute garlic, onions, and carrots. Add the boneless fish flesh. Season with remaining calamansi juice (to taste, be careful not to make it too sour), soy sauce (be careful not to put too much that it darkens the meat), salt and pepper to taste. Mix well. Adjust accordingly. Let it cool."
- "Once cool, add the beaten raw egg- Leave a little for coating the skin later. Mix well. This serves as the binder to let you easily stuff it back in to the fish skin. Don&#39;t over stuff, so it cooks well when you fry. There is a tendency for it to become mushy (mouth feel) when it&#39;s over stuffed. Once stuffed, the fish should look slender but not loose. Sew close the opening with a needle and string. Any clothes needle, string or thread will do."
- "Heat oil in an oblong pan. Oil should cover half of the fish when you lay it on the pan. Make sure it&#39;s hot enough before you put the fish in. Brush the stuffed fish with the remaining beaten egg before frying. Fry one side first. Fish should be golden on the white areas and a little blackish on the darker areas of the skin before turning it on the other side. (See photo) Once golden, serve and enjoy. You can use the remaining fish-egg mix as filling for lumpia (like spring rolls) or omelettes. :) They&#39;re delicious!"
