recipeingredient:
- "250 gr 00 flour"
- "3 eggs"
- "1 tbsp salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Spread the flour on the counter, giving it a crown/volcano shape"
- "Add the eggs in the middle of said crown. Make sure they don’t spill, as it will make the dough hard to mix."
- "Add the salt to the flour, making sure to sprinkle it evenly across the crown"
- "Using a spoon, start breaking the eggs and whisking them, while slowly incorporating the surrounding flour."
- "Once the mix is no longer runny, start incorporating all the ingredients with your hands. Pretty much squeeze it all together several times until all the fragmented ingredients start looking as a unified dough."
- "(Corrections/may not be required) If during the previous step the dough is either too runny after absorbing all the flour or the dough is too dry/sandy and not coming together, then we need to fix it. If it is too runny, incorporate more flour little by little, until it no longer feels sticky. On the contrary, if the dough was too dry, then use very little water to hydrate it. I usually get my hands wet and try and mix the dough again, usually that moist helps to bind the ingredients"
- "Once your dough is starting to take shape, knead the dough for 5 minutes. The idea is to allow gluten to form, so try and “break” the dough a bit while kneading."
- "After kneading, wrap your dough on either cling wrap or a kitchen cloth and let it rest for 45 minutes. This step is very important, because by allowing the dough to rest, we allow the gluten to form properly, which leads to an easier and better stretching of the dough afterward"
- "Unwrap your dough on your counter and cut it into manageable chunks. Consider that the smaller the chunk, the easier it will be to stretch, but it also yields for shorter pasta. I usually go for somewhere in between 2 to 4 chunks."
- "To stretch the dough, grab each smaller piece of dough and shape it into a rectangle"
- "Using the rolling pin, stretch the dough until you get a long flat oval/rectangle. Spread enough flour on top of it to prevent it from sticking, and now fold the tips inwards, so they meet in the middle. Flatten the dough again, taking care not to press too much. Repeat this process one more time, and then gently unfold the dough to get a thin sheet of pasta"
- "Now in order to cut our pasta, first we need to Cut the edges of the sheets so we turn them into rectangles. This will guarantee fetuccini of consistent length."
- "Fold the pasta sheets (or roll it) taking care for it not to stick, and cut noodles 1.5 cm thick. Spread them over a chopping board or oven tray so they take their final shape"
- "If you’re cooking them right away, remember that fresh pasta needs to be cooked only for a few minutes (3-4), and need to be cooked in a big pot of boiling water."

Hello everybody, it's Louise, welcome to my recipe site. Today, I'm gonna show you how to prepare a distinctive dish, fetuccini. It is one of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I'm gonna make it a bit unique. This will be really delicious.

Fettuccine Alfredo is one of the most basic and delicious pasta recipes EVER—and it couldn&#39;t be easier to make! Our recipe is a little untraditional (there&#39;s heavy cream) but it&#39;s just as easy. When my husband needed to go on a heart-smart diet, I had to come up with new ways to get more vegetables into our daily menus. This meatless spaghetti sauce is a winner; it&#39;s even prettier with spinach fettuccine. —Marianne Neuman, East Troy, Wisconsin Fettuccine pasta tastes its best when served in a rich, creamy Parmesan cheese sauce made with real cream and butter.

Fetuccini is one of the most well liked of current trending foods in the world. It's appreciated by millions every day. It is simple, it's quick, it tastes yummy. They're fine and they look wonderful. Fetuccini is something that I've loved my entire life.


To get started with this recipe, we have to prepare a few ingredients. You can cook fetuccini using 3 ingredients and 14 steps. Here is how you cook it.

##### The ingredients needed to make Fetuccini:

1. Get 250 gr 00 flour
1. Make ready 3 eggs
1. Get 1 tbsp salt


But this delicious duo tastes even better when combined with hot cooked pasta, Parmesan cheese, and fresh thyme and basil. Our Corn-and-Bacon Fettuccine is best made in the summer, when corn and fresh herbs are in season. It&#39;s a lovely sauce served just as it is, but to make fettuccine Alfredo even more special you can add a protein or vegetables. Some grilled chicken, sliced into strips, turns the dish into chicken Alfredo.

It&#39;s a lovely sauce served just as it is, but to make fettuccine Alfredo even more special you can add a protein or vegetables. Some grilled chicken, sliced into strips, turns the dish into chicken Alfredo. If you add cooked shrimp, the pasta becomes shrimp Alfredo; for a vegetarian Alfredo, toss in some sautéed mushrooms or steamed asparagus. The &#34;Alfredo&#34; in fettuccine Alfredo is Alfredo di Lelio who operated a restaurant in Rome. Legend has it that he fancied up a basic pasta with butter-and-cheese to appeal to his wife, who was suffering from morning sickness.
