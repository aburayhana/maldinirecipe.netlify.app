recipeinstructions:

- "Add in 1 tbsp vegetable oil. Add the sliced onion. Stir fry for around three minutes then add in the garlic and chilli. Keep moving the ingredients around the wok quickly. Next add in the spring onions and toss everything together. Add in the cooked chips."
- "Sprinkle over the garlic granules and season with salt and a small pinch of white pepper. Keep tossing everything together until all ingredients are evenly distributed. Remove from the heat. Serve up whilst still hot and enjoy! :)"
