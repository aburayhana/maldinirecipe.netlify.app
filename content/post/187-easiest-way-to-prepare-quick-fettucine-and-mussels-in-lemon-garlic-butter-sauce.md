recipeingredient:
- "2 lb fettucine fresh or boxed"
- "2 lb mussels live and in shell"
- "4 tbsp olive oil extra virgin"
- "2 stick butter"
- "4 clove garlic minced"
- "1 large lemon zest and juice"
- "1/4 tsp salt"
- "1 medium handful basil chopped"
- "1/2 cup pecorino Romano cheese"
- "1/2 tsp ground black pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "Cook the fettuccine in boiling water, and a smidge of salt, until al dente.  Rinse under cool water to stop the cooking process, and then set aside."
- "Rinse and then steam the mussels, in a steamer basket, until they open up.  If they don&#39;t open, don&#39;t eat them.  Run under cool water to stop the cooking process and clean out some grit, and then set aside."
- "Heat the oil on low, and then melt the butter a stick at a time.  I know, this is so not health food."
- "Add the garlic, simmer for a moment, and then add the lemon juice and zest.  Be careful, adding the lemon should toast up the garlic pretty quickly, so remove the pan from heat for a moment as needed to keep the garlic from burning.  Toasted is good, burnt is bad."
- "Add the salt and basil, and simmer a minute or two."
- "Mix in the Romano and pepper, and add any extra salt to taste."
- "Add the fettucine to the sauce, and toss the fettucine in the sauce."
- "Add the mussels to the fettucine in sauce, and toss the mussels, fettucine, and sauce."
