Start with a big hunk of beef flank steak. Shredded beef and vegetables that resemble a heap of colorful rags - that&#39;s Ropa Vieja. But flank still continues to be used in nearly all ropa vieja recipes out of tradition because of its shape - the grains of the cut yield long strands of shredded beef resembling the dish&#39;s namesake, torn clothing. Although Ropa Vieja shredded beef was originally a Cuban dish, my family uses this flavorful beef in a variety of Mexican food dishes (tacos, enchiladas, burritos, nachos, salads). When he cooked the clothes, his love for his family turned them into a wonderful beef stew.
