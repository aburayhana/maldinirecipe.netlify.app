- "1 can Crushed tomatoes"
- "3 Basil leaves"
- "2 tsp sugar"
- "To taste Sazon Dominicano"
- "1 tbsp ground dried garlic"
- "1 can  sauce"
recipeinstructions:
- "Core the bottom of cabbage being careful not to cut the leaves. You want to just take out the large stem holding the leaves together so when you cook the cabbage in water the leaves will soften but not break."
- "While the cabbage cooks in boiling water, cook the rice üçö in the rice cooker. This will make easier for you to get take care of other dishes while rice cooks in the cooker."
- "In a bowl mix the ground meat with the sazon (I&#39;ll publish my sazon again) set aside."
- "When the leaves from the cabbage start to fall off from the head, take them out gently as to not break them. Place the leaves in a bowl to cool. Once all of the leaves you need from the cabbage have fallen off and have cooled, cut ‚úÇÔ∏è part of the rib (long stem) from each of them. This will make easy to roll the cabbage."
- "In a sauce pan add the crushed tomatoes and tomato sauce with the basil leaves, garlic and sugar. Let it simmer and adjust seasoning to your taste."
- "Once your rice has cooked, in a large bowl add the rice and uncooked meat mixture. After mixing it well, you can start adding this to the cabbage leaves and roll like a burrito tucking in the sides of the cabbage as you roll."
- "In a large pan add some of the sauce to the bottom to keep cabbage rolls from burning. Gently add the rolls around the pot adding sauce as you layer them up. Once you have added all of your rolls in the pan, add some water üíß to help cook them. Turn heat to medium and let it slowly cook. Remember to taste your sauce in case you need to adjust the flavor."
- "The cooking of these will take about 20 to 25 minutes because you are really just cooking the meat at this point and making the sauce richer. Once you are happy with your cabbage rolls they are good to eat."
