recipeingredient:
- "12 lb whole boneless choice ribeye"
- " LA Preferida Sazon Seasoning"
- " Montreal Seasoning"
- " Olive oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Take the ribeye out of the frig and light the charcoal in the smoker."
- "Make the Montreal seasoning. Using your favorite store bought brand is fine I just like to reduce the the amount of black pepper and bump up the coriander a bit."
- "Coat the entire ribeye in olive oil."
- "Lightly coat all sides with the sazon."
- "Cover with the Montreal seasoning. This will give it beautiful flavor and a nice crust."
- "Once the smoker hits 275° put the ribeye on. I use an upright barrel smoker with a water pan."
- "Cook low for 4ish hours until the internal temp hits 125°. Watch carefully to maintain the temp and add wood chunks as needed. I used pecan wood to not overwhelm with a strong flavor with something like a mesquite."
- "Do not let the Internal temp get above 130°"
- "Once it hits 125° take off, wrap in foil and stash in a dry cooler for a minimum 1 hour."
- "Slice and save all the drippings to serve over the top."
