- "follow directions for the oven bag and place penir in oven bag. Pour in any marinade that has dripped from the penir"
- "allow at least 4 hours of cooking time at 350°F"
- "when you see that the penir is pretty much done open oven bag at the top exposing the skin and cook until the skin is crunchy, you may also remove the skin at this point and fry it for faster results. I personally like it from the oven."
- "note: when you buy the penir, look for the one with the least fat"
