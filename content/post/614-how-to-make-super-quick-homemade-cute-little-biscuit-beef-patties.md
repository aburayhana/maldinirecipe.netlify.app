- "Drain the ground beef and put back in the pan. Add tomato sauce (could be more or less depending on how soupy you want the meat). Add a little more sofrito and simmer for about 10 minutes."
- "Open can of biscuits and separate them. Either roll them out with a rolling pin or use you hand to flatten them (what I do)."

- "Put in deep fryer. I usually do 2 at a time. Flip them once the bottom gets golden brown (about 2 minutes) and leave in til the other side evens out."
